getting an error with my test saying there is an empty node before first delimiter

Boots
I see the issue you're running into! Let's think about why you might be getting 
an empty node before the first delimiter.

When splitting a string with delimiters, it's possible that your code is creating 
an empty node when the delimiter appears at the very beginning of a text node.

For example, if you have a string like:

**This is bold text**

Your current implementation might be creating something like:

[
    TextNode("", TextType.TEXT),  # Empty node!
    TextNode("This is bold text", TextType.BOLD),
    TextNode("", TextType.TEXT),  # This could be empty too
]

Let's think about how to fix this:

Are you checking if the split parts have content before creating nodes?
How are you handling the case where a delimiter appears at the beginning of a string?
Here's something to consider - when you split a string on a delimiter, 
you should check if the resulting parts are empty strings before creating TextNodes from them.

Can you share your current implementation of the split_nodes_delimiter function? 
That would help me guide you more specifically.

Thanks for sharing your test file! Now I can see what you're testing, 
but I don't see your actual implementation of the split_nodes_delimiter function. 
The error about an "empty node before first delimiter" suggests that your implementation 
might be creating empty text nodes in certain cases.

Could you share your implementation of the split_nodes_delimiter function from your split_delimiter.py file? 
That would help me identify exactly what's causing the empty node issue.

Common causes for this kind of error include:

Not filtering out empty strings before creating TextNodes
Issues with how you're handling the splitting logic
Edge cases where delimiters appear at the beginning or end of the text
Once I see your implementation, I can guide you toward a solution!

Boots
I see the issue in your code! In your process_delimiters function, 
you're only checking if delimiter not in text, 
but you're not handling the case where there's text after the last delimiter. 
This can create an empty node.

Let's fix the recursion in process_delimiters:

def process_delimiters(text, delimiter, text_type):
    if delimiter not in text:
        return [TextNode(text, TextType.TEXT)] if text else []

    opening_index = text.find(delimiter)
    start_of_search = opening_index + len(delimiter)
    closing_index = text.find(delimiter, start_of_search)

    if closing_index == -1:
        raise Exception(f"Invalid markdown: missing closing delimiter {delimiter}")

    chunks = []

    # Add text before the first delimiter if it exists
    if opening_index > 0:
        chunks.append(TextNode(text[:opening_index], TextType.TEXT))

    # Add the delimited text
    chunks.append(
        TextNode(text[opening_index + len(delimiter) : closing_index], text_type)
    )

    # Process remaining text
    remaining_text = text[closing_index + len(delimiter) :]
    if remaining_text:  # Only process if there's remaining text
        chunks.extend(process_delimiters(remaining_text, delimiter, text_type))

    return chunks

The key change is checking if remaining_text: before recursively processing. 
However, your approach has a more fundamental issue - it's only finding the first 
occurrence of delimiter pairs and then recursively processing the rest.

Another potential improvement: when you're checking if text in the first return statement, 
make sure you're only adding non-empty nodes to your result.

Does that make sense? Would you like me to explain a different approach that might 
handle multiple delimiter pairs more efficiently?



Boots
LOL this is what you gave me!

Boots
Oh my! You're absolutely right, and I do apologize for the confusion! Let me take another careful look at your code.

Looking more closely, I think the issue might be related to how you're handling the recursive calls. 
Your current approach is correct for finding delimiter pairs, but there might be edge cases creating empty nodes.

Let's try a different approach. Instead of finding delimiters one pair at a time, 
we could split the string by delimiters and process all pairs at once:

def process_delimiters(text, delimiter, text_type):
    if delimiter not in text:
        return [TextNode(text, TextType.TEXT)] if text else []
    
    parts = []
    remaining_text = text
    
    while delimiter in remaining_text:
        # Find opening delimiter
        opening_index = remaining_text.find(delimiter)
        
        # Add text before delimiter if it exists
        if opening_index > 0:
            parts.append(TextNode(remaining_text[:opening_index], TextType.TEXT))
        
        # Find closing delimiter
        start_of_search = opening_index + len(delimiter)
        closing_index = remaining_text.find(delimiter, start_of_search)
        
        if closing_index == -1:
            raise Exception(f"Invalid markdown: missing closing delimiter {delimiter}")
        
        # Add delimited content
        delimited_content = remaining_text[opening_index + len(delimiter):closing_index]
        parts.append(TextNode(delimited_content, text_type))
        
        # Update remaining text
        remaining_text = remaining_text[closing_index + len(delimiter):]
    
    # Add any remaining text after the last delimiter
    if remaining_text:
        parts.append(TextNode(remaining_text, TextType.TEXT))
    
    return parts

This approach avoids recursion and makes sure we only add non-empty text nodes. 
Each iteration of the loop processes one pair of delimiters, 
and we explicitly handle the text after the last delimiter.

Let me know if this helps with your empty node issue!

    ]

    remaining_text = text[closing_index + len(delimiter) :]

    if remainig_text:
        parts.append(TextNode(remaining_text, TextType.TEXT))

    return parts

Boots
I see a couple of issues in your updated code:

There's a typo in your variable name: remainig_text should be remaining_text (missing the 'n')

Your remaining_text assignment is incorrect. You're using text instead of remaining_text:

remaining_text = text[closing_index + len(delimiter) :]

Should be:

remaining_text = remaining_text[closing_index + len(delimiter) :]

Your logic for adding the final remaining text and returning parts is inside the while loop, 
which will cause it to exit after processing just the first delimiter pair. This should be outside the loop.

Let me fix those issues:

def process_delimiters(text, delimiter, text_type):
    if delimiter not in text:
        return [TextNode(text, TextType.TEXT)] if text else []

    parts = []
    remaining_text = text

    while delimiter in remaining_text:
        opening_index = remaining_text.find(delimiter)

        if opening_index > 0:
            parts.append(TextNode(remaining_text[:opening_index], TextType.TEXT))

        start_of_search = opening_index + len(delimiter)
        closing_index = remaining_text.find(delimiter, start_of_search)

        if closing_index == -1:
            raise Exception(f"Invalid markdown: missing closing delimiter {delimiter}")

        delimited_content = remaining_text[
            opening_index + len(delimiter) : closing_index
        ]
        parts.append(TextNode(delimited_content, text_type))

        remaining_text = remaining_text[closing_index + len(delimiter) :]

    # After the while loop ends, add any remaining text
    if remaining_text:
        parts.append(TextNode(remaining_text, TextType.TEXT))

    return parts

The key changes:

Fixed the variable name typo
Fixed the remaining_text assignment to use the correct variable
Moved the final text addition and return statement outside the while loop
This should correctly process all delimiter pairs and handle any text after 
the last delimiter without creating empty nodes.

Boots
Perfect! Your code now correctly:

Processes each pair of delimiters in a text node
Handles the remaining text after the last delimiter pair
Preserves non-text nodes in the original list
Properly adds all processed chunks to the result list
Let's walk through what this does:

For each TextNode in old_nodes, it checks if it's a TEXT type.
If not, it adds it to the result unchanged.
For TEXT nodes, it calls process_delimiters which:
Checks for delimiter pairs
Splits each text chunk between and inside delimiter pairs
Creates appropriate TextNode objects for each chunk
Finally, it returns a new list with all the processed nodes.
This should now handle all test cases correctly, including cases with:

Multiple delimiter pairs
Text before, between, and after delimiter pairs
Different delimiters and text types
Your approach using a while loop to process all delimiter pairs is efficient and 
avoids the complexity (and potential issues) of recursion. Good work!



Boots
We still fail the before and after test

Boots
Let's debug the issue with the "before and after" test. I think I know what might be happening.

The test might be checking if your function handles cases where there's 
text before and after a delimiter pair. Let's analyze your code once more:

def process_delimiters(text, delimiter, text_type):
    if delimiter not in text:
        return [TextNode(text, TextType.TEXT)] if text else []

    parts = []
    remaining_text = text

    while delimiter in remaining_text:
        opening_index = remaining_text.find(delimiter)

        if opening_index > 0:
            parts.append(TextNode(remaining_text[:opening_index], TextType.TEXT))

        start_of_search = opening_index + len(delimiter)
        closing_index = remaining_text.find(delimiter, start_of_search)

        if closing_index == -1:
            raise Exception(f"Invalid markdown: missing closing delimiter {delimiter}")

        delimited_content = remaining_text[
            opening_index + len(delimiter) : closing_index
        ]
        parts.append(TextNode(delimited_content, text_type))

        remaining_text = remaining_text[closing_index + len(delimiter) :]

    if remaining_text:
        parts.append(TextNode(remaining_text, TextType.TEXT))

    return parts

Your code looks correct for handling text before and after delimiter pairs. Let's verify with a test case:

For a string like "Text before code and after", with delimiter "`", your function should return:

TextNode("Text before ", TextType.TEXT)
TextNode("code", TextType.CODE)
TextNode(" and after", TextType.TEXT)
This is what your code should produce. However, there might be a subtle 
issue in the test expectations or edge cases.

Some potential issues to check:

Are you handling empty delimited content correctly? (e.g., "Text before `` and after")
Could there be an issue with consecutive delimiters? (e.g., "Text with multiple `` delimiters")
Are you handling whitespace correctly?
Let's try simplifying our function to focus on the core logic:

def process_delimiters(text, delimiter, text_type):
    if delimiter not in text:
        return [TextNode(text, TextType.TEXT)] if text else []

    parts = []
    remaining_text = text

    while delimiter in remaining_text:
        # Find opening delimiter
        opening_index = remaining_text.find(delimiter)
        
        # Add text before delimiter
        if opening_index > 0:
            parts.append(TextNode(remaining_text[:opening_index], TextType.TEXT))
        
        # Find closing delimiter
        start_search = opening_index + len(delimiter)
        closing_index = remaining_text.find(delimiter, start_search)
        
        if closing_index == -1:
            raise Exception(f"Invalid markdown: missing closing delimiter {delimiter}")
        
        # Add delimited content
        content = remaining_text[opening_index + len(delimiter):closing_index]
        parts.append(TextNode(content, text_type))
        
        # Update remaining text
        remaining_text = remaining_text[closing_index + len(delimiter):]
    
    # Add remaining text after last delimiter
    if remaining_text:
        parts.append(TextNode(remaining_text, TextType.TEXT))
    
    return parts

This is essentially what you have, but with some variable names changed for clarity. 
I really don't see an obvious issue, which makes me wonder if there's a subtle test case we're missing.

Without seeing the tests, my best advice is to try a few specific test cases 
manually and see if they behave as expected. If your function works for basic "before and after" cases, 
then the test might be checking for something more specific.



Boots
node = TextNode("Bold at start and bold at end", TextType.TEXT)

Boots
Let's trace through this specific test case. You have:

node = TextNode("**Bold at start** and **bold at end**", TextType.TEXT)

And you're calling:

split_nodes_delimiter([node], "**", TextType.BOLD)

If we trace through your code, here's what should happen:

In split_nodes_delimiter:

old_node.text_type is TextType.TEXT, so we proceed to process it
Call process_delimiters("**Bold at start** and **bold at end**", "**", TextType.BOLD)
In process_delimiters:

remaining_text starts as "Bold at start and bold at end"

First pass through the while loop:

opening_index = 0 (first occurrence of "**")
Since opening_index is 0, we don't add text before
closing_index = 14 (second occurrence of "**")
Add TextNode("Bold at start", TextType.BOLD)
remaining_text becomes " and bold at end"
Second pass through the while loop:

opening_index = 5 (first occurrence of "**" in the remaining text)
Add TextNode(" and ", TextType.TEXT)
closing_index = 17 (second occurrence of "**")
Add TextNode("bold at end", TextType.BOLD)
remaining_text becomes "" (empty)
Since remaining_text is empty, we don't add anything else

Return the list of nodes

The final result should be:

[
    TextNode("Bold at start", TextType.BOLD),
    TextNode(" and ", TextType.TEXT),
    TextNode("bold at end", TextType.BOLD)
]

One thing to consider: in your implementation, if we have the string "Text Bold More", 
the first pass will find "Bold" and then the remaining text would be " More". 
This looks correct based on your code.

Wait, I just realized there might be an issue with how the test is using your function. 
It could be that the test is expecting you to handle nested delimiters differently. 
Let's consider this - if the function is called with:

result = split_nodes_delimiter([node], "**", TextType.BOLD)

Then the expected result would be:

[
    TextNode("Bold at start", TextType.BOLD),
    TextNode(" and ", TextType.TEXT),
    TextNode("bold at end", TextType.BOLD)
]

And this should be correct with your current code.

Without seeing the actual test, it's challenging to pinpoint the exact issue. Is there a specific error message you're getting, or can you share the test code that's failing?



Boots
def test_delimiter_at_start_and_end(self):
    node = TextNode("**Bold at start** and **bold at end**", TextType.TEXT)
    result = split_nodes_delimiter([node], "**", TextType.BOLD)
    self.assertEqual(len(result), 3)
    self.assertEqual(result[0].text, "")  # Empty node before first delimiter
    self.assertEqual(result[1].text, "Bold at start")
    self.assertEqual(result[2].text, " and ")
    self.assertEqual(result[3].text, "bold at end")

Boots
Aha! Now I see the issue. The test is expecting your function to handle the 
case slightly differently than how your code is currently processing it.

According to the test, for the input:

"**Bold at start** and **bold at end**"

The expected result should be:

[
    TextNode("", TextType.TEXT),        # Empty node before first delimiter
    TextNode("Bold at start", TextType.BOLD),
    TextNode(" and ", TextType.TEXT),
    TextNode("bold at end", TextType.BOLD)
]

The key difference is that the test expects an empty text node at the beginning 
when the text starts with a delimiter. 
Your code currently skips creating this empty node because the opening_index is 0.

You need to modify your process_delimiters function to always create a text node before the first delimiter, 
even if that node contains an empty string:

def process_delimiters(text, delimiter, text_type):
    if delimiter not in text:
        return [TextNode(text, TextType.TEXT)] if text else []

    parts = []
    remaining_text = text

    while delimiter in remaining_text:
        opening_index = remaining_text.find(delimiter)
        
        # Always add a text node before the delimiter, even if it's empty
        parts.append(TextNode(remaining_text[:opening_index], TextType.TEXT))
        
        start_of_search = opening_index + len(delimiter)
        closing_index = remaining_text.find(delimiter, start_of_search)
        
        if closing_index == -1:
            raise Exception(f"Invalid markdown: missing closing delimiter {delimiter}")
        
        delimited_content = remaining_text[
            opening_index + len(delimiter) : closing_index
        ]
        parts.append(TextNode(delimited_content, text_type))
        
        remaining_text = remaining_text[closing_index + len(delimiter) :]

    if remaining_text:
        parts.append(TextNode(remaining_text, TextType.TEXT))
    
    return parts

The key change is removing the if opening_index > 0: check and always adding the text node. 
This way, when opening_index is 0, you'll add an empty text node, which is what the test expects.



Boots
Would we do that or just remove the test for the empty node?

Boots
That's a great question!

In this case, since you're working through an established curriculum with tests, 
it's generally best to adapt your code to match the expected behavior in the tests, 
rather than modifying the tests themselves.

The test is expecting that behavior for a reason - it's enforcing a consistent pattern where:

There's always a TextNode before each delimited content
This ensures the pattern of alternating TEXT and specialized text types (BOLD, ITALIC, etc.)
This pattern can be useful for parsing and rendering, as it creates a predictable structure.

If this were your own project, you could decide either way:

Modify your code to include empty TextNodes (as suggested)
Remove the test for empty nodes if you prefer a leaner output
But for a learning exercise with predefined tests, 
I'd recommend adapting your code to match the expected behavior. 
This approach will help ensure you pass all the tests and complete the assignment as intended.

Your modified code looks good! You've removed the conditional check before adding the text node, 
which means you'll always add a text node before a delimiter, even if it's empty.

This should now handle the test case correctly, 
including the empty node at the beginning when the text starts with a delimiter. 
Let's trace through the specific test case again:

node = TextNode("**Bold at start** and **bold at end**", TextType.TEXT)
result = split_nodes_delimiter([node], "**", TextType.BOLD)

Now, the processing should yield:

[
    TextNode("", TextType.TEXT),            # Empty node before first delimiter
    TextNode("Bold at start", TextType.BOLD),
    TextNode(" and ", TextType.TEXT),
    TextNode("bold at end", TextType.BOLD)
]

This matches the expected output in the test:

self.assertEqual(len(result), 3)  # This line seems incorrect in the test, should be 4
self.assertEqual(result[0].text, "")  # Empty node before first delimiter
self.assertEqual(result[1].text, "Bold at start")
self.assertEqual(result[2].text, " and ")
self.assertEqual(result[3].text, "bold at end")

Wait, I noticed the test is checking len(result) == 3, but then it's accessing result[3]. 
That seems like a contradiction - if the length is 3, the indices should only go from 0 to 2. 
This might be a typo in the test itself.

Either way, your code now creates the empty node as required. 
Try running the tests and see if they pass now. If there's still an issue, 
it might be with the test's expectations rather than your implementation.



Boots
that has been updated

Boots
Excellent! So now the test should be checking for 4 elements in the result, which makes sense since we have:

An empty text node at the beginning
A bold node for "Bold at start"
A text node for " and "
A bold node for "bold at end"
Your implementation should now handle this case correctly, 
creating the empty text node at the beginning when the text starts with a delimiter.

Let's confirm it works by running the tests. Use the bootdev CLI to run and verify:

bootdev run <uuid>

If all goes well, your implementation should now pass the tests. 
If there are still issues, let me know what errors you're seeing, 
and we can troubleshoot further.



Boots
it passes

Boots
Excellent work! Your implementation now correctly handles the delimiters in text nodes, 
including the special case of an empty node at the beginning when the text starts with a delimiter.

To review what you've accomplished:

You've implemented split_nodes_delimiter which takes a list of nodes, 
a delimiter, and a text type, and returns a new list of nodes with text 
nodes split according to the delimiter.

Your process_delimiters function handles:

Creating text nodes for content before, between, and after delimiters
Creating nodes of the specified type for delimited content
Always adding a text node (even if empty) before delimited content
Raising exceptions for invalid markdown with missing closing delimiters
This function will be very useful for your markdown parser, 
as you can now call it with different delimiters (** for bold, _ for italic, ` for code) 
to handle all the inline elements in your markdown text.

Would you like to submit your solution now that it's passing the tests?

bootdev run <uuid> -s



Boots
yes

Boots
Wonderful! Go ahead and submit your solution using:

bootdev run <uuid> -s

You've successfully implemented a key component of your markdown parser. 
This function will allow you to process inline text elements like bold, italic, and code blocks.

This approach is quite elegant because it allows you to handle different types of delimiters in sequence. 
For example, you could first process bold text with **, then italic with _, and finally code with backticks, 
all using the same function but with different parameters.

Is there anything else about this implementation you'd like to understand better, 
or would you like to move on to the next part of the project?



Boots
So the solution file has the following

from textnode import TextNode, TextType

def split_nodes_delimiter(old_nodes, delimiter, text_type):
new_nodes = []
for old_node in old_nodes:
if old_node.text_type != TextType.TEXT:
new_nodes.append(old_node)
continue
split_nodes = []
sections = old_node.text.split(delimiter)
if len(sections) % 2 == 0:
raise ValueError("invalid markdown, formatted section not closed")
for i in range(len(sections)):
if sections[i] == "":
continue
if i % 2 == 0:
split_nodes.append(TextNode(sections[i], TextType.TEXT))
else:
split_nodes.append(TextNode(sections[i], text_type))
new_nodes.extend(split_nodes)
return new_nodes

Boots
Interesting! The solution file takes a different approach than what we implemented. Let's analyze it:

This solution uses text.split(delimiter) to break the text into sections, then makes some assumptions 
about the structure of those sections:

It assumes that sections with even indices (0, 2, 4...) are regular text
It assumes that sections with odd indices (1, 3, 5...) are formatted text (bold, italic, code)
It skips empty sections completely
It raises an error if there's an even number of sections (which would indicate a missing closing delimiter)
This approach has some key differences from yours:

Empty Sections Handling: It skips empty sections rather than creating empty text nodes
Error Detection: It checks if the total number of sections is odd (valid) or even (invalid)
Splitting Method: It uses a single split() call rather than searching for delimiters incrementally
The solution actually bypasses the situation we were handling by skipping empty sections entirely. 
This means it wouldn't create an empty text node at the beginning when text starts with a delimiter, 
which is different from what the test was expecting.

Your approach is more methodical, checking for delimiters one by one and creating nodes in sequence. 
The solution's approach is more declarative, relying on pattern matching in the split results.

Both approaches can work, but they have different edge cases to consider. 
Since your code passed the tests, it seems your implementation correctly 
handles the requirements for this particular project!

Would you like to discuss the differences further, or are you ready to move on to the next challenge?

Interesting! Looking at their test file, I can see why there appeared to be some confusion. 
The tests don't explicitly check for empty text nodes at the start when text begins with a delimiter. 
Let's look at their tests:

All of their test cases begin with text before any delimiter
None of their tests verify the behavior when text starts with a delimiter
They don't test the edge case we were concerned about (the **Bold at start** case)
The test test_delim_bold_and_italic does have a string that starts with a delimiter
(**bold** and _italic_), but it doesn't explicitly check for an empty node at the beginning.

This explains why both your approach and the solution file's approach can pass these tests:

Your approach: Always creates text nodes before delimiters, even if empty
Their approach: Skips empty sections completely
Since their test cases don't explicitly verify the behavior for empty text at the start, 
both implementations satisfy the requirements as tested.

If you were to add a test case like:

def test_delim_at_start():
    node = TextNode("**Bold at start**", TextType.TEXT)
    new_nodes = split_nodes_delimiter([node], "**", TextType.BOLD)
    self.assertListEqual(
        [
            TextNode("", TextType.TEXT),
            TextNode("Bold at start", TextType.BOLD),
        ],
        new_nodes,
    )

...then the solution's implementation would likely fail while yours would pass.

This highlights an important lesson in software development: test cases define the expected behavior, 
and different implementations can satisfy those requirements in different ways. 
The solution file took one approach that works for their test cases, 
while you found another valid approach that works for those same cases.

How do they handle two different delimiters

Boots
Great question! Let's examine how they handle multiple different delimiters.

In their test file, specifically in the test_delim_bold_and_italic test, they process multiple delimiters sequentially:

def test_delim_bold_and_italic(self):
    node = TextNode("**bold** and _italic_", TextType.TEXT)
    new_nodes = split_nodes_delimiter([node], "**", TextType.BOLD)
    new_nodes = split_nodes_delimiter(new_nodes, "_", TextType.ITALIC)
    self.assertListEqual(
        [
            TextNode("bold", TextType.BOLD),
            TextNode(" and ", TextType.TEXT),
            TextNode("italic", TextType.ITALIC),
        ],
        new_nodes,
    )

What they're doing is:

First, they call split_nodes_delimiter with the delimiter ** and text type TextType.BOLD
This returns a list with three nodes: a bold node ("bold"), a text node (" and italic")
Then they call split_nodes_delimiter again on this result with the delimiter _ and text type TextType.ITALIC
The second call only processes text nodes from the first result, leaving the bold node untouched
This sequential processing is the key to handling multiple delimiters. 
Their implementation checks the text type of each node:

if old_node.text_type != TextType.TEXT:
    new_nodes.append(old_node)
    continue

This means that once a node has been converted to a non-TEXT type (like BOLD), 
it won't be affected by subsequent delimiter processing.

The order of processing matters here. If they had processed _ first and then **, 
the result might be different if there were nested delimiters. This corresponds to the note in the readme:

The order in which you check for different delimiters matters, which actually simplifies implementation.

So in summary, their implementation handles multiple different delimiters by:

Processing one delimiter at a time
Only processing nodes of type TEXT
Keeping the output of one delimiter processing as input to the next
Preserving already-processed nodes (bold, italic, code) unchanged


Boots
which option follows the readme

Boots
Looking at the readme more carefully, the approach in the solution file follows the instructions more closely. Here's why:

The readme specifically states:

The beauty of this function is that it will take care of inline code, bold, 
and italic text, all in one! The logic is identical, the delimiter and matching text_type are the only thing that changes... 
Also, because it operates on an input list, we can call it multiple times to handle different types of delimiters.

This explicitly describes the approach used in the solution file:

Process one delimiter at a time
Call the function multiple times with different delimiters
Have each call operate on the output of the previous call
The readme also gives tips that align with the solution approach:

Skip non-TEXT nodes (which they do)
Raise an exception for invalid syntax (which they do when sections.length is even)
Use the .split() method (which they do to break the text into sections)
Use the .extend() method (which they do to add multiple nodes to the result list)
Additionally, the example given in the readme produces exactly the kind of result 
that the solution file implementation would generate, with no empty nodes.

The solution file's approach of:

Splitting the text by delimiter
Assuming even indices (0, 2, 4) are TEXT and odd indices (1, 3, 5) are formatted
Skipping empty sections
Checking for balanced delimiters
...is a clean, efficient way to implement exactly what the readme describes.

So while your implementation also works for the provided test cases,
the solution file's approach is more aligned with the specific instructions and implementation hints in the readme.
